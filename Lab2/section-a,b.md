# Section A: Concept Check — Answers

1. In Python, a 1D array is commonly implemented using a **list**.

2. Inserting an element at the beginning of a list requires shifting **all (n)** elements, making it an O(**n**) operation.

3. Deleting an element from the middle of a list requires shifting all elements **after (to the right of)** it, to fill the gap.

4. A left rotation by k positions moves the first k elements to the **end** of the array.

5. Linear search checks elements **one by one, sequentially from the start** while binary search requires the array to be **sorted** first.

6. A sparse matrix stores only **non-zero** elements, along with their **row index** and **column index**.

7. The standard triple format for a sparse matrix entry is (**row**, **column**, **value**).

# Section B: Trace the Logic — Answers

### 1. Array operations on [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

**Step 1 — Insert 25 at index 2:**
```
[10, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50]
```
(25 is placed at index 2; 30, 40, 50 each shift one position right)

**Step 2 — Delete the element at index 0:**
```
[20, 25, 30, 40, 50]
```
(10 is removed; every remaining element shifts one position left)

**Step 3 — Rotate the resulting array left by 2 positions:**
```
[30, 40, 50, 20, 25]
```
(the first 2 elements, 20 and 25, are moved to the end, in order)

### 2. Linear search for 19 in [5, 12, 8, 19, 3, 27]

| Step | Index checked | Value at index | Match? |
|------|---------------|-----------------|--------|
| 1    | 0             | 5               | No     |
| 2    | 1             | 12              | No     |
| 3    | 2             | 8               | No     |
| 4    | 3             | 19              | **Yes — found at index 3** |

Search stops at step 4; the value is found at **index 3**.

### 3. Binary search for 15 in [2, 4, 7, 10, 15, 20, 22] (indices 0–6)

| Step | low | high | mid | array[mid] | Comparison | Action |
|------|-----|------|-----|------------|------------|--------|
| 1 | 0 | 6 | 3 | 10 | 10 < 15 | search right half → low = mid + 1 = 4 |
| 2 | 4 | 6 | 5 | 20 | 20 > 15 | search left half → high = mid - 1 = 4 |
| 3 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 15 | 15 == 15 | **found at index 4** |

Value 15 is found at **index 4** after 3 comparisons.

### 4. Sparse triple representation of D (row-major order)

```
D = [[0, 0, 5],
     [0, 8, 0],
     [3, 0, 0],
     [0, 0, 0]]
```

Scanning row by row, the non-zero entries are:

| Row | Column | Value |
|-----|--------|-------|
| 0   | 2      | 5     |
| 1   | 1      | 8     |
| 2   | 0      | 3     |

Sparse triples: **(0, 2, 5), (1, 1, 8), (2, 0, 3)**

(Some conventions also prepend a header triple `(4, 3, 3)` meaning 4 rows, 3 columns, 3 non-zero entries — that header is counted separately from the data triples, per the note in Section D Q1.)

### 5. Storage comparison for matrix D

- **Full 2D representation:** 4 rows × 3 columns = **12 values stored** (every cell, zero or not).
- **Sparse representation:** 3 non-zero entries × 3 values each (row, column, value) = **9 values stored** (not counting the header).

For this particular small, fairly dense matrix (3 out of 12 entries non-zero, 25%), the sparse form still stores fewer raw values (9 vs 12) — but the gap is small, which is exactly the kind of data point Section D Q3 asks you to reason about at larger sizes and different densities.
