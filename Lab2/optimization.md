# Section D: Space Optimization Analysis — Answers

*(Based on running `sparse_matrix.py` / Program 3)*

## 1. Space used, in terms of m, n, k

For an `m x n` matrix with `k` non-zero elements:

- **Full 2D representation:** stores **`m x n`** values (every cell, zero or not).
- **Sparse triple representation:** stores **`3k`** values (`k` triples, 3 values per triple — row, column, value — not counting the header).

## 2. Test results

Two 6x6 matrices were run through Program 3's convert-to-sparse operation.

**Sparse test matrix (roughly 80% zero):**
```
0 0 0 2 0 0
0 5 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 8 0
0 0 0 0 8 0
0 0 0 6 0 0
0 0 9 0 0 4
```

**Dense test matrix (fewer than 20% zero):**
```
1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 9 1 2 3
4 5 6 7 8 9
1 2 3 0 5 6
7 8 0 1 2 3
4 0 6 7 0 9
```

| Matrix | Size | Zero elements | Non-zero (k) | Full stores (m×n) | Sparse stores (3k) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Sparse test | 6x6 = 36 | 29 (80.6%) | 7 | 36 | 21 |
| Dense test | 6x6 = 36 | 4 (11.1%) | 32 | 36 | 96 |

Both were verified by reconstructing the full matrix from its sparse form with `from_sparse` — in both cases the reconstruction matched the original exactly.

## 3. Crossover point

The sparse representation only saves space while `3k < m x n`, i.e. while:

```
k < (m x n) / 3
```

In other words, sparse storage stops saving space once **more than roughly one-third (about 33%) of the elements are non-zero**. Below that point, each non-zero element "costs" 3 stored values instead of 1, but you skip storing the (far more numerous) zeros; above that point, the 3x overhead per non-zero element outweighs the savings from skipping zeros.

The test data confirms this directly:
- Sparse test matrix: 7/36 ≈ 19% non-zero (well under ⅓) → sparse wins, 21 vs 36
- Dense test matrix: 32/36 ≈ 89% non-zero (well over ⅓) → sparse loses badly, 96 vs 36

## 4. Real-world example of a naturally sparse matrix

A large social network's adjacency matrix (rows and columns are users, entry = 1 if two users are connected) is naturally sparse: any individual user is directly connected to only a tiny fraction of the total user base, so the vast majority of entries in the full matrix are 0. Storing it as triples (or an equivalent adjacency-list structure) instead of a full grid is what makes it feasible to hold networks with millions of users in memory at all.
