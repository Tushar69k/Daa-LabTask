"""
Lab Task 2 - Part 4: Count the Steps

Single loop:
    FOR i = 1 to 5
        PRINT i

Nested loop:
    FOR i = 1 to 5
        FOR j = 1 to 5
            PRINT i, j

1. How many times does the single loop run (n = 5)?
2. If it ran from 1 to n, and n = 20, how many times will it run?
3. How many times does the inner PRINT run in total (n = 5)?
4. If both loops ran from 1 to n, and n = 10, how many times will PRINT run?
